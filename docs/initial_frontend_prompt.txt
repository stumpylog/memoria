I want you to create a React.js application, using react-bootstrap for styling, which does the following.  Assume the backend is functional and does not need to be generated
The application should use Typescript, jsx, etc.
The application should use Vite.
The application should use block body syntax
The application should use icons from bootstrap-icons.
Other packages may be installed if required, such as react router
uses axios for the http client
HTTP errors should be handled
Makes requests to http://localhost:8000 as the backend base url
The backend provides /api/csrf/, /api/login/, /api/logout/, /api/user/, which do what they sound.  The user route provides fields from a Django user model
The backend uses session based auth (from Django)
The application should use a branded bootstrap navigation bar
The navigation should include / (the home page), /folder, and /people
The components, except the homepage, should be skeletons for now.
Under a dropdown on the right should be profile, settings (if the user is a staff or superuser) and logout links.
The user menu should be separated from the main navigation links.
The navigation bar should include a light or dark theme picker, which is applied to the whole application, to the left of the user dropdown.
The theme should default to following the system theme.
No part of the application except the login page should be accessible until successful login.
All http will be requested as json.
If the user logs out, they should redirect to a logout page, which includes a message and a link to log back in
We should use react-bootstrap for bootstrap integration.
We should define models for the types used, such as a User.
The brand should be loaded from static/images/brand.svg (and scaled if needed)
