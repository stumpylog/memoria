I want you to create a React.js application, using react-bootstrap for styling, which does the following.  Assume the backend is functional and does not need to be generated.  Also assume a template has been created, using the react-ts template and pnpm.
The application should use Typescript, jsx, etc.
The application should use Vite.
The application should use block body syntax, ie with a return statement
The application should use icons from bootstrap-icons.
Other packages may be installed if required, such as react router, react redux.
uses axios for the http client
HTTP errors should be handled and displayed as Bootstrap toasts
The API errors will be formatted via Pydantic
Makes requests to http://localhost:8000/api/ as the backend base url, but this should be easy to configure
The backend provides /api/csrf/, /api/login/, /api/logout/, /api/user/, which do what they sound.  The user route provides fields from a Django user model, as well as a profile object with a default_items_per_page int, and a string timezone
The backend uses session based auth (from Django).
The api client should handle injecting the csrf token as needed into X-CSRFToken
The application should use a branded bootstrap navigation bar
The navigation should include / (the home page), /folders, and /people
The components, except the homepage, should be skeletons for now.
The homepage should greet the user by name
Under a dropdown on the right should be links to profile page, settings page (if the user is a staff or superuser) and a logout link.
The user menu should be separated from the main navigation links.
The navigation bar should include a light or dark theme picker, which is applied to the whole application, to the left of the user dropdown.
The theme should default to following the system theme.
No part of the application except the login page should be accessible until successful login.
Route protection should be encapsulated in case updates want to add more restrictions, like user permissions
All http will be requested as json.
If the user logs out, they should redirect to a logout page, which includes a message and a link to log back in
We should use react-bootstrap for bootstrap integration.
We should define models for the types used, such as a User.
The brand should be loaded from URL static/images/brand.svg (and scaled if needed)
The API client should abstract away access to the backend routes, such as exact route paths
